1. For each problem, provide in more than 100 words, a short, high-level description of the problem;
your approach to solve it; and any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve them.

Problem 1 (Reverse): Accepts strings from standard input and writes them in reverse order to standard output

Problem 2 (Euclidean Distance): accepts n as cli arg, two n-dimensional lists x and y, and writes the euclidean distance between two vectors represented by x and y.

Problem 3 (Birthday Problem): Accepts trials as cli arg, runs trials num of experiments, sample until two people share a birthday, and writes the output

Problem 4 (Transpose): Accepts m and n as cli args, m by n floats from stdin representing the elements of an m by n matrix a, and writes to stdout the transpose of a.

Problem 5 (Pascal's Triangle): Accepts n as cli arg and writes Pn to stdout

Problem 6 (Generating the Waltz): Accepts the minuet and trio tables from stdin, generates a random sequence of 32 measures according to a ruleset, and writes the sequence to stdout

Problem 7 (Playing the Waltz): Accepts a sequence of 32 ints representing the 32 measures of a waltz, plays to stdaudio. Includes small test checks that must pass for program to run.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, course staff, other), and
the nature of help received. Nope
